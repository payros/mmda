# Multi-Media Data Aggregator (MMDA)

## Purpose
The MMDA allows the users to name, annotate, store, and organize collections of data files into data
aggregates called Data-Aggregates (DAGR for short). A DAGR may contain an arbitrary number of multimedia
files, e.g. text documents, images, audio, video, and other previously created DAGRs. The system
should provide functionality for storing, searching and retrieving the DAGR database using the DAGRâ€™s
name, or keywords in their annotation, and other metadata (see below) that is automatically generated
at the time of its creation.

## Installation
*First, make sure you have both [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and the [node-oracledb](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/INSTALL.md) driver installed* 


- Clone or download the project
- Run `npm install` from the project's root directory
- Add a `.env` file with DB credentials to the project's root directory
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` or `127.0.0.1:3000` from your preferred browser


## Evironment Variables
To setup the evironment variables for the DB connection you will have to create a `.env` file in the root directory using the following template:

```
DB_USERNAME=[YOUR_USERNAME]
DB_PASSWORD=[YOUR_PASSWORD]
DB_CONNECTSTRING=[YOUR_CONNECT_STRING]
```

Ask your DB admin for your specific credentials.
